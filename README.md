# Fake Mail Generator with Julia
This is a sample project for showing how to manage Julia's environments and
packages.

Run `julia` in the root directory of this project and go to the package mode
with `]`. First activate the project with `activate .` and then install the
packages with `instantiate`. Now you can exit Julia's REPL and run the project

```bash
julia --project=. generator.jl
```
